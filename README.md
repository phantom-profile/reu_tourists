# DB for witchers

### Project business logic

I have recently completed game "Witcher 2" and main plot was about escaped witcher who 
became a king slayer. I thought that it would never happen it there was a database for all witchers.
Also every witcher has his own unique silver sword, so it also should be registered here.

#### It should contain:
1) List of Witchers with their names and their school
2) It should have auth protection with secret word. So only Witchers elders can access it
3) It should have CRUD operations for classes such as witchers and schools

### Technical aspects of project:


* It is written on Ruby 3.0.0 with framework Ruby on Rails 6.14.1
    * It is very comfortable programming language and RoR is great tool for setting up projects such as web app bd manager with GUI
    * It has well separated 3-level structure and it is easy for understanding while checking lab
    *

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* Deployment instructions

* ...
